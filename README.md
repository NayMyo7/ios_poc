For the POC, the given problem is, we want you to develop a Topup application with VIPER archetecture.
This application contion two function, Login and Topup.

For Login feature,
1. We want to check input validation.
2. We also want to add loading when `Log in with account` button is clicked.
3. After login button is click, call the endpoint `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NayMyo7/ios_poc/master/json/login_response.json`.
The JSON response must contain account information and the available balance. (Remark: Only the Saving account and Current account can make Topup.)

For Topup feature,
1. We want to check input validation.
2. The user can select the Account Number.
3. We also want to the available balance after the account have been selected.
4. The phone number can be enter or can be select from phone contact.
5. We also want to add loading when `Mobile Topup` button is clicked.
6. After topup button is clicked, call the endpoint `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NayMyo7/ios_poc/master/json/topup_response.json` to get Amount, Discount and Net Amount.
7. If the response is success, show the confirm screen.
8. When `Confirm` button is clicked, show the transaction password dialog.
9. When `OK` button in the dialog is clicked, call the endpoint `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NayMyo7/ios_poc/master/json/topup_confirm_response.json` to make actual topup.
10. If the response is success, show the topup success screen.
(Remark: The topup screen must be differ from sample screenshot. We want to show success icon, success message, transaction ID together with data from confirm screen.)

Please, feel free to contact me if there's anything you would like to know more or would like to clarify something. First of all, please reply me with the estimate timeline you would take to develop this POC.
